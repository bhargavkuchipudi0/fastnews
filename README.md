# FASTNEWSNOW
## Stay tuned with the latest news updates

    A daily news web application where all different types of news around the world can be
    searched and filtered at a single place. This application was built with React JS.

    - Head Lines
    - Categories
    - Trending
    - Technology
    - Fashion
    - Editors choice. etc..,
    
    I built this application using Newapi.org. They are providing api's for news articals.
    I have the developer version which is free. But, it wont allow me to make cross-origin
    requests. It works only in the local host. 
    Although, I have hosted the application on heroku (here)[https://fastnewsnow.herokuapp.com].
    
    I am looking for an alternative to resolve this limitation by creating my own server and
    collecting the data using Node JS and mongo DB.
